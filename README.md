Mock test for Flow Traders mental maths test.

I wrote this very quickly for my own use. There is little information about the test available so I wasn't sure how accurate this was.
Having taken the real test I can now confirm sections 1 and 2 are pretty similar to this but section 3 has other types of questions other
than the multiplication ones included here.

If you do want to try and use this, just run the main script and it will give you a mock test and score you. The questions are randomised
and you get some results information back. You can choose to do just one section by editing the section variable (see main section of code).
